wsgiapptools is a collection of simple tools for WSGI applications, e.g. tools
that work in a WSGI stack and help make applications easier to write.

cookies
-------

Simple cookie management.

A "CookieCutter" is added to the WSGI environ by the cookies middleware. The
cookie cutter can be retrieved from the environ at any time and cookies can be
set and deleted at any time (and from anywhere) until the response headers are
sent.


flash (requires cookies)
------------------------

Simple "flash" message handling.

Flash messages (yes, you can set more than one) can be set with a single call.
Any flash messages are later converted to cookies by the flash WSGI middleware.

A function is also provided to extract the flash messages from the request's
cookies for display. The flash cookies are automatically removed at the same
time.
